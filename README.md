# Capstone 1 - Pet Adoption Prediction

This folder contains the work for my first capstone project. The purpose is to apply data science techniques to a dataset, including:

- Data wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis / Data storytelling
- Statistical data analysis
- Machine learning

The file structure is as follows:

- *Notebook*: PetAdoptionPrediction.ipynb (Notebook is broken down into Data Wrangling, EDA, and ML sections)
- *Presentation*: PetAdoptionPredictionPresentation_IThisted.pdf
- *Report:* Pet Adoption Prediction Final Report.pdf - Report

Data sources: 
- PetFinder Data [https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data)
- dogtraits.csv - dog breed traits extracted from [https://www.dogtime.com](https://www.dogtime.com)

The goal of the machine learning models is to predict whether a pet will be adopted or not based on the information extracted from his PetFinder profile. Logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosting models have been implemented and assessed.
The report contains an overview and discussion of all work performed.
